Architecture CA Slides will contain following details 


Detailed description and key features of each architectures.
 Business domains and scenarios where they are widely used.
 Practices followed in the industry for implementing them.
 Their major strengths and weaknesses if any.
 Comparision between the two architecture.
 Any viable alternatives.
 Conclusion.


Requirements
Overview:

Web-scale applications like social networks, real-time analytics, or
e-commerce sites deal with a lot of diverse data, whose volume and
velocity exceed the limits of traditional database systems. Building a
well-designed, reliable and functional big data application that
caters to a variety of end-user latency requirements can be an
extremely challenging proposition. It can be daunting enough to just
keep up with the rapid pace of technology innovation happening in
this space, let alone building applications that work for the problem
at hand.
Fortunately, scale and simplicity are not mutually exclusive, there
are certain high-level architectural constructs that can help in
mentally visualize how different types of applications fit into the big
data architecture and how some of these technologies are
transforming the existing enterprise software landscape.
Among the several architectures that have emerged in recent years
to tackle this problem, two widely used are Lambda and Kappa
architecture. These are known to be fault-tolerant,scalable and
extensible.
The main focus of our study would be to get an in depth
understanding of these two architectures, key components and
technologies involved, also domains and scenarios in which these
are applied. We would also be evaluating other alternatives
currently used in industry such as Zeta architecture among others.
Based on our objective evaluation and understanding obtained, we
would be providing an comparision between the studied
architectures. We would then try to highlight the use cases or
criterias which would entail adoption of a specific architecture.

Make sure that you also cover not only the benefit of those architecture, but also analyze the tradeoff (if any) made in that architecture.
